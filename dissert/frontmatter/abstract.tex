\abstract{
Edwards curves are a new normal form for elliptic curves that exhibit some
    cryptographically desirable properties and advantages over the typical
        Weierstrass form.
Because the group law on an Edwards curve (normal, twisted, or binary) is
    \textit{complete} and \textit{unified}, implementations can be safer from
    side channel or exceptional procedure attacks.
The different types of Edwards provide a better platform for cryptographic
    primitives, since they have more security built into them from the
    mathematic foundation up.

Of the three types of Edwards curves---original, twisted, and binary---there
    hasn't been as much work done on binary curves.
We provide the necessary motivation and background, and then delve into the
    theory of binary Edwards curves.
Next, we examine practical considerations that separate binary Edwards curves
    from other recently proposed normal forms.
After that, we provide some of the theory for binary curves that has been
    worked on for other types already: pairing computations.
We next explore some applications of elliptic curve and pairing-based
    cryptography wherein the added security of binary Edwards curves may come
    in handy.
Finally, we finish with a discussion of \texttt{e2c2}, a modern C++11 library
    we've developed for Edwards Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
