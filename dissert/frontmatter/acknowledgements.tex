\acknowledgements{I'd like to thank my advisor, Dr. Yuliang Zheng, for his
    guidance and support.
His knowledge, insight, and willingness to work with me helped me reach the
    realization and completion of this immense undertaking.
I am also grateful to Dr. Gabor Hetyei for serving as my mathematics advisor
    while I worked on this project, despite his very busy schedule.
The entire Mathematics Department at UNC Charlotte was very supportive and
    taught me a lot, for which I am very thankful.
My parents have never stopped supporting me; they fostered a curiosity and love
    of learning in me that got me to where I am.
Last but certainly not least, my wonderful wife Jessica helped me in more ways
    than I can count.
Without her love and support, I would not have finished this dissertation.
